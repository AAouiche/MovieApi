# Movie Api
The ActivityProject Backend serves as the core server side component of a full stack app designed to manage movies and reviews. This RESTful API provides the necessary endpoints for user authentication, review creation, and other interactions.


Additional Details:
Security: Incorporates authentication and authorisation strategies to ensure secure access to the application's features.

Real-time Communication: Utilises SignalR hubs for enabling real time interactions.

Image Handling: Offers services for image upload and management.

Persistence: Employs Entity Framework for ORM, facilitating robust and agile data handling.

The backend is designed with a focus on clean architecture, ensuring separation of concerns and making the system easy to maintain and extend. It's currently deployed and running live on Railway along with the front end.
